    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <h5>Defining a Function</h5>
    <p>Some functions produce a value. Others will produce a side effect.</p>
    <script>
      //Side effect example
      const sayHello = function () {
        console.log("Hello"); //the side effect, no value is produced
      };
      sayHello();
      //A function that produces a value...
      const power = function (base, exponent) {
        let result = 1;
        for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
          console.log(count, "base: ", base);
          result *= base;
        }
        return result;
      };

      console.log(power(2, 10));
      //console.log(globalVariable); //not available in this script tag
    </script>
    <h5>Bindings and Scope</h5>
    <p>
      When declare a variable outside of all functions or blocks that variable
      is in the global scope and is available to all functions and blocks.
    </p>
    <script>
      let globalVariable = 400;
      function scopeTest() {
        let localVariable = "Can't see me in the global scope";
        console.log(globalVariable); //this is totally fine b/c globalVariable is available in the global scope AKA everywhere!
      }
      scopeTest();
      //console.log(localVariable); this causes on error
    </script>
    <h5>Nested Scope</h5>
    <p>
      Blocks and functions can live within other blocks and functions. This
      affects the scope of the variables within them.
    </p>
    <script>
      const hummus = function (numberOfPeople) {
        const ingredient = function (amount, unit, name) {
          let ingredientAmount = amount * numberOfPeople;
          if (ingredientAmount > 1) {
            unit += "s";
          }
          console.log(`${ingredientAmount} ${unit} ${name}`);
        };
        ingredient(1, "can", "chickpeas");
        ingredient(0.25, "cup", "tahini");
        ingredient(0.25, "cup", "lemon juice");
        ingredient(1, "clove", "garlic");
        ingredient(2, "tablespoon", "olive oil");
        ingredient(0.5, "teaspoon", "cumin");
      };

      console.log(hummus(2));
      //WE CANNOT access ingredients here. It's only available inside fX hummus.
    </script>
    <h5>Functions as values</h5>
    <p>Ex: let fireMissiles = function() { console.log("Missiles fired!") }</p>
    <p>
      This structure is a function expression but notice that we used "let."
      This means we can change the value that fireMissiles points. FYI we can't
      do this if we use const instead of let.
    </p>
    <script>
      //How we change the value of functions...
      let status = "Peace";
      let fireMissiles = function (status) {
        if (status === "Peace") {
          console.log("Don't fire missiles!");
        }
      };
      fireMissiles("Peace");
      //But we can change what fx fireMissiles does
      fireMissiles = function () {
        console.log("I don't care, fire the missiles!");
      };
      fireMissiles();
    </script>
    <h5>Function declarations</h5>
    <p>
      function sayYes() {console.log("Yes")} is in the format of a function
      declaration. These functions HOIST!
    </p>
    <script>
      //This totally works and shows that function sayYes is hoisted to the top.
      sayYes();
      function sayYes() {
        console.log("Yes");
      }
    </script>
    <h5>Arrow functions</h5>
    <p>let sayBye = () => {console.log("Bye")}. This is an arrow function.</p>
    <p>
      What's unique about arrow functions? If they only have one parameter, we
      can omit the parantheses and we also do not need the return statement!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrow functions and function expressions generally do the same thing.
      Arrow functions are less verbose and are seen often.
    </p>
    <script>
      //Here's an example of an arrow function
      const sayBye = () => {
        console.log("Bye");
      };
      sayBye();
      const square1 = (x) => {
        return x * x;
      };
      const square2 = (x) => x * x; //shows that we don't need the return statement b/c it's an arrow function.
      console.log(square1(2), square2(3));
    </script>
    <h5>Optional Arguments</h5>
    <p>
      We can have a function that takes one parameter, pass lots of arguments
      but in JavaScript, it'll take the first and ignore the rest. Also if a
      function takes in many and we don't pass enough, the missing arguments
      will be taken as undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there's important behavior to see in functions. We can assign values
      to arguments but override their values if we choose.
    </p>
    <script>
      function exponentEquation(base, exponent = 2) {
        let result = 1;
        for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
          result *= base;
        }
        return result;
      }

      console.log(exponentEquation(4)); //we pass 4 and let function keep 2 as the exponent
      // → 16
      console.log(exponentEquation(4, 4)); // we pass 4 AND change exponent 4 as well.
      // → 256
    </script>
    <h5>Closure</h5>
    <p>
      We can call the same function twice but this doesn't cause problems. Why?
      This is because the local bindings are created each time we call the
      function. The multiple calls of the same function don't mess each other.
      The ability to reference a specific instance of a local binding is called
      CLOSURE!
    </p>
    <script>
      //Closure at play...
      function sayGreeting(msg) {
        let greeting = msg;
        return () => msg;
      }
      let hello1 = sayGreeting("What's up?"); //we can call sayGreeting here
      let hello2 = sayGreeting("Yo dude!"); //and here without issues thanks to closure!
      console.log(hello1());
      console.log(hello2());
      //We can get more complicated with closure here
      function multiplier(factor) {
        console.log(factor);
        return (number) => number * factor; //the key is here, this is an arrow function that takes in a number as parameter and returns that number multiplied by the factor
        //The return works because of CLOSURE. It captures the 2 when we called fX multiplier in twice, then it grabs the 6 as the factor and keeps 2 as the number to perform its operation
      }
      let twice = multiplier(2);
      console.log(twice(6)); //yields 12
      console.log(twice(7)); //yields 14
    </script>
    <h5>Recursion</h5>
    <p>
      Functions can call themselves within their own code code block! We can
      cause infinite loops with Recursion if we're not careful. It does a form
      of looping. To prevent infinite looping we need to make sure we have a
      base condition that will stop the recursive function.
    </p>
    <script>
      //Here's a recursive version of exponent function we've played with
      function recursivePower(base, exponent) {
        if (exponent === 0) {
          console.log("Base condition present, recursion stopped");
          return 1;
        } else {
          return base * recursivePower(base, exponent - 1);
        }
      }
      console.log(recursivePower(3, 2));
      //WebDev Simplified examples
      //Let's write a for loop that counts down to zero from a starting number of our choice
      function countDown(n) {
        for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
          console.log("Number: ", i);
        }
        console.log("For loop is done");
      }
      //now let's rewrite it with recursion
      function recursiveCountdown(n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
          console.log("Recursive countdown stopped");
          return;
        }
        console.log("Number during recursion", n);
        recursiveCountdown(n - 1); //
      }
      /* How does this function actually work?
      1. We call recursiveCountdown(3).
      2. Is 3 <= 0? No, so we continue down the code block
      3. We log 3 to the console
      4. But then we call recursiveCountdown(3-1) and start over
      5. Is 2 <= 0? No, so we continue down the code block
      6. We log 2 to the console
      7. But then we call recursiveCountdown(2-1) and start over
      8. We go through again and eventually we get to the situation where ask: Is 0 <=0? YES! We hit the return statement and our recursion function stops.
      */
      //Write a recursive function that adds up numbers
      //REMEMBER the if statement determines our base!
      function recursiveCountUp(n) {
        if (n >= 6) {
          console.log("recursiveCountUp stopped");
          return;
        }
        console.log("Number during count up:", n);
        recursiveCountUp(n + 1);
      }
      //Let's do it again with addition
      function sumRange(n) {
        let total = 0;
        for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
          total += i;
        }
        return total;
      }
      //Now let's perform the same task with recursion
      function recursiveAddition(n, total = 0) {
        if (n <= 0) {
          console.log("recursiveAddition stopped");
          return total;
        }
        console.log(total);
        return recursiveAddition(n - 1, total + n);
      }
      /* What happens when we do recursiveAddition(3)?
      1. Is 3 <=0? No
      2. The total is 0 during the 1st invoke of recursiveAddition()
      3. We call recursiveAddition(3 - 1, 0 + 3)
      4. Is 2 <=0? No
      5. The total is now 3
      6. We call recursiveAddition(2 - 1, 3 + 2)
      7. Is 1 <=0? No
      8. The total is now 5
      9. We call recursiveAddition(1 - 1, 5 + 1)
      10. Is 0 <=0? YES! We hit "return total" and the recursion stops!
      */

      //These are examples show us how recursion works but they don't take advantage of recursion. Let's see one where recursion is our friend!
      //Goal: Print all names of every child within this tree.
      function printChildrenRecursive(t) {
        //1st: set up guard clause to end the recursion
        if (t.children.length === 0) {
          return;
        }
        t.children.forEach((child) => {
          console.log(child.name);
          printChildrenRecursive(child);
        });
      }
      const tree = {
        name: "John",
        children: [
          {
            name: "Jim",
            children: [],
          },
          {
            name: "Zoe",
            children: [
              { name: "Kyle", children: [] },
              {
                name: "Sophia",
                children: [
                  { name: "Mike", children: [] },
                  { name: "Lucy", children: [] },
                ],
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      };
    </script>
    <h5>Growing Functions</h5>
    <p>
      Let's say we want to make a function thar prints the number of cows and
      chickens we own with padded zeros up to three digits. For example if we
      have 3 chickens and 10 cows we'd print:
    </p>
    <p>003 Chickens</p>
    <p>010 Cows</p>
    <p>
      The JavaScript in this example is meant to show how we should write code
      to keep us from repeating ourselves. We don't want to write more functions
      that doing the same thing.
    </p>
    <script>
      function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens) {
        let cowString = String(cows); //Take the number of cows and convert to string
        while (cowString.length < 3) {
          //if length of cowString is less than 3 add zeros until it hits three
          cowString = 0 + cowString;
        }
        console.log(`${cowString} Cows`);
        let chickenString = String(chickens);
        while (chickenString.length < 3) {
          chickenString = 0 + chickenString;
        }
        console.log(`${chickenString} Chickens`);
      }
      //What if we want to know the inventory of another animal? We could do the following...
      function printZeroPaddedWithLabel(amount, animal) {
        let amountString = String(amount);
        while (amountString.length < 3) {
          amountString = "0" + amountString;
        }
        console.log(`${amountString} ${animal}`);
      }

      function printAnimalInventory(cows, chickens, pigs) {
        printZeroPaddedWithLabel(cows, "Cows");
        printZeroPaddedWithLabel(chickens, "Chickens");
        printZeroPaddedWithLabel(pigs, "Pigs");
      }
      //But we can write easier code to understand but going after padding our animal count with zeros
      function threeZeroPadding(amount, padding) {
        let amountString = String(amount);
        while (amountString.length < padding) {
          amountString = "0" + amountString;
        }
        return amountString;
      }

      function printAnimalCountSimple(cows, chickens, pigs) {
        console.log(`${threeZeroPadding(cows, 3)} Cows`);
        console.log(`${threeZeroPadding(chickens, 3)} Chickens`);
        console.log(`${threeZeroPadding(pigs, 3)} Pigs`);
      }
    </script>
    <h5>Functions and Side Effects</h5>
    <p>
      Generally functions either do a side effect or return a value. FYI one
      function can do both.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, our function that adds zeros to our animal count is giving us
      a side effect
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the function that tells us how many we have is return a value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions that return values are generally more useful because we can use
      them in different ways.
    </p>
    <h6>Pure Functions</h6>
    <p>
      These simply return a value with no side effect and isn't affected by any
      other functions. They always produce the same value.
    </p>
    <script>
      //Pure function example:
      function add(a, b) {
        return a + b; //this function always returns a + b
      }
      //Impure function example:
      function subtract(c, d) {
        console.log(c - d); //SIDE EFFECT!!
        return c - d;
      }
    </script>
    <h5>Summary</h5>
    <script>
      //Here's how we can write functions...
      // Define f to hold a function value
      const f = function (a) {
        console.log(a + 2);
      };

      // Declare g to be a function
      function g(a, b) {
        return a * b * 3.5;
      }

      // A less verbose function value
      let h = (a) => a % 3;
      //Practice
      //Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
      function returnMins(numberOne, numberTwo) {
        return Math.min(numberOne, numberTwo);
      }
      //Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
      function isEven(n) {
        if (n < 0) {
          console.log("isEven stopped");
          return;
        } else if (n % 2 === 0) {
          isEven(n - 2);
          console.log(n, true);
        } else {
          console.log(n, false);
        }
      }
      //Bean counting
      function countLetter(string, letter) {
        let totalBs = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
          const element = string[i];
          if (element === letter) {
            totalBs += 1;
          }
        }
        return totalBs;
      }
      console.log(countLetter("BB", "B"));

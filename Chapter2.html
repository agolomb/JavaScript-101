    <h4>Program Structure</h4>
    <h5>Bindings</h5>
    <p>
      To catch and hold values, JavaScript makes use of variables. Keywords let,
      var, and const allow us to define a binding. Take a look at the JavaScript
      to see how we do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that with let and var, we can reassign the values that our
      variables our bound to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also bind values to variables in one line as long as we separate
      them by commas. See the JavaScript and console below for examples of this.
    </p>
    <h5>Naming variables</h5>
    <p>
      Generally we can name variables anything we want but there's important
      rules we must follow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can't start with integers.</li>
      <li>The only special characters they can have are $ or _.</li>
      <li>
        You can't name a variable "let", "const", or "var". These are KEYWORDS
        in JavaScript that have special abilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        There's lots of other keywords in JavaScript with special abilities. WE
        CANNOT use any of these to name our variables.
      </li>
      <li>Examples: return, for, typeof, while,</li>
      <li>
        There's many more, if the code breaks on your variable, check the name!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>FUNCTIONS</h4>
    <p>
      prompt() is an example of a default function. You can play with it the
      console. You can type prompt("Enter password) to see it work. It's used
      much in programming but it's helpful to play with and experiment.
    </p>
    <h5>Return values</h5>
    <p>
      When functions produce a value, we say that they return a value. Look at
      the .max and .min examples in the JavaScript below to see some simple
      examples with return at play.
    </p>
    <h5>Control Flow</h5>
    <p>In JavaScript, the code is read from Top to Bottom.</p>
    <h5>Conditonal Execution</h5>
    <p>
      Sometimes we might not want our code to be read in a straight line top to
      bottom. We might want a certain thing to happen or something else to
      happen. We call this Conditonal Execution! We is if statements to take
      advantage of this. Look at the JavaScript to see this in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type "squareMyNumber()" in the console to how this Conditional Execution
      works.
    </p>
    <p>
      With conditional execution, we can check for more than one condition. We
      can use if, else if, and else to check lots of different conditions to
      decide what code we want to execute.
    </p>
    <h5>While and Do Loops</h5>
    <p>
      Loops will let our code run multiple times for us. We can do these actions
      with keyword "while", "for", "forEach", etc. There are many looping
      functions we can do in JavaScript. Take a look at the JavaScript and the
      console to see looping at play.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want count the number of times our while loop fires we can add in a
      counter to our function. See JavaScript below for an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      do loops are similar to while loops. However, do loops ALWAYS run at least
      once, then check to see if they should keep going. Check the JavaScript
      example to see how this works.
    </p>
    <h5>For Loops</h5>
    <p>
      For loops are shorter and more comprehensive way to write while loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also stop a for loop and get out of it with keyword "break". Take a
      look at an example below with us using the modulo % operator
    </p>
    <h5>Dispatching on a value with switch</h5>
    <p>
      Sometimes you might see a bunch of if, else if, and else statements
      written in a chain. The construct of "switch" can be used to make it
      easier to read the same conditoinal logic.
    </p>

    let five = 5; // 5 is bound to the variable called five.
    //But now we can do this...
    console.log(five * five);
    console.log(five * 5); //this works because the value of "five" is a number

    //Reassignment of variables
    var name = "Alex";
    console.log("name: ", name);
    //now reassign it
    name = "ben";
    console.log("reassigned name: ", name);
    //We can do the exact same thing with let but not const

        console.log("Your number is between 50 and 100");

    do {
      myName = prompt("Enter your first name."); //the do loop fires and pulls up the prompt.
    } while (myName !== "Alex"); //if this remains true, the loop keeps firing. Meaning if I don't type "Alex" the while piece is true. Once I type Alex, the while condition becomes false and exits the loop.
    console.log("You entered 'Alex' and do loop stopped looping");
    */
    //Here's a really simple for loop.
    for (let number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2) {
      console.log("for loop is logging each number and stops at 12: ", number);
    }
    //For loop with a break when we use the modulo operator
    /* We start at 1 and add 1 each time, when hit a number divisible by 5, our break fires and we exit the loop.
     */
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      if (i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log(`${i} % is 0. Breaking out of the loop.`);
        break;

    //A common way to write if, else if, and else
    let x = "value3";

    else console.log("x isn't any of those");
    //But let's see switch in action. If invoke fX checkWeather, then type something, it checks each "case", then if that case is true, it fires the console.log and hits the break, or it just keeps going and going until hits true or the default.
    function checkWeather() {
      switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
        case "rainy":
          console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");

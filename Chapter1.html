    <h4>Values, Types, and Operators</h4>
    Open up the console to see the results of the functions written in
    JavaScript!

    <p>
      Computers store billions of bits in its memory. With JavaScript we
      represent those bits in chunks called VALUES. Values can be integers,
      decimals, strings, or even functions to name a few.
    </p>
    <h5>Numbers</h5>
    <p>
      When dealing with fractional numbers like Pi, these digital numbers are
      approximations. They are not 100% precise like 1 or 15.
    </p>
    <h5>Arithmetic</h5>
    <p>
      We can do arithmetic with JavaScript. "+" and "*" are operators. When
      order of operations matters, be sure to use () in your code to perform
      your arithmetic as intended.
    </p>
    <h4>The MODULO operator %</h4>
    <p>
      The % operator is used when dealing with remainders. Here's some examples
      to see how this works
    </p>
    <p>
      314 % 100 = 14. What happened? 300/100 = 3 and then we have the remainder
      of 14
    </p>
    <p>
      144 % 12 = 0. What happened? 144/12 = 12. There's no remainder. So the
      result is zero!
    </p>
    <p>Take a look in the console for some practice results of modulo.</p>
    <h5>Special Numbers</h5>
    <p>
      Infinity and negative infinity are special numbers available to us but it
      generally isn't very useful and will often yield NaN (also a special
      number). Keep in mind the NaN is a number type in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h5>Strings</h5>
    <p>
      Strings are text that are written inbetween '', "", or ``. Keep in mind
      that if you went to start a new line in string (when press enter), you can
      only do this when using the backticks OR when can use "\n" if using '' or
      "" inside our string.
    </p>
    <h5>Backticks and strings</h5>
    <p>
      We can do more tricks with strings when we use the backtick. Look in the
      console and the JavaScript examples for how this works. ***We call these
      TEMPLATE LITERALS***
    </p>
    <h5>Unary Operators</h5>
    <p>
      typeof is a unary operator. The typeof unary operatory can ONLY take one
      argument. If it you pass it more than it'll only read the last argument.
    </p>
    <h5>Boolean Values</h5>
    <p>These are true and false.</p>
    <h5>Comparison Operators</h5>
    <p>This is when we use <, >, ==, ===, !=, >=, and <=</p>
    <h5>Logical Operators</h5>
    <p>This is when we use && or ||.</p>
    <h5>Ternary Operator</h5>
    <p>
      This is a conditional operator where if the condition is true, we pick the
      first value OTHERWISE we go with the second value.
    </p>
    <h5>Null and undefined</h5>
    <p>
      These are both considered to be empty. They are the absence of anything
      meaningful. They are considered values but don't have any information. We
      can treat both null and undefined interchangeably.
    </p>
    <h5>Type Coercion</h5>
    <p>
      This is an important part of JavaScript because it can cause problems.
      Take a look at the JavaScript and console to see how this can cause
      issues. It's best to use the triple equals "===" to defensively protect
      our program from issues that can come from JavaScript's type coercion.
    </p>
    <h5>Odd behavior of Logical Operators && and || AKA Short Circuit</h5>
    <p>
      Both && and || will try to convert the first value (left side) to a
      Boolean to make a decision. Then depending on what happens, it'll return
      the original left side value or the right side value. ***If both are
      falsy? The last value is returned. Look at JavaScript for demonstrations
      of this phenomena.
    </p>
    <h5>Truthy and Falsy</h5>
    <p>
      Besides "true" and "false" certain values are interpreted as true or false
      that we might not expect as humans. Like the number zero. Zero is
      interpreted by the machine as false, so we say that zero is falsy. Another
      example of a falsy is "" (an empty string).
    </p>
    <h5>Falsy Values</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>false: The boolean value false.</li>
      <li>0: The number zero.</li>
      <li>-0: Negative zero (uncommon).</li>
      <li>'' (Empty String): An empty string.</li>
      <li>null: Represents the absence of any value.</li>
      <li>undefined: Represents the absence of a defined value.</li>
      <li>
        NaN: Stands for "Not-a-Number" and represents an invalid arithmetic
        operation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Truthy values</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>true: The boolean value true.</li>
      <li>
        All non-zero numbers: Any positive or negative number, including
        decimals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-empty strings: Any string that contains at least one character.
      </li>
      <li>All objects: Including arrays, functions, and other objects.</li>
      <li>Arrays: Even if they are empty, they are considered truthy.</li>
      <li>
        Functions: Even if they don't return anything explicitly, they are
        truthy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Special objects like Infinity and -Infinity: They are considered truthy.
      </li>
    </ol>

    //Type Coercion
    console.log("6" + 2); //Yields 62 even though we're adding a string to an integer
    //BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE MINUS THE DATA TYPES
    console.log("5" - 1); //Yields 4

    console.log(null || "some text"); //null is falsey, so our || goes with the right side value
    console.log("Alex" || "alex"); //"Alex" is considered true, so our || goes with the right side
    console.log(null || undefined); //Chooses undefined, the last value
    console.log(undefined || null); //Again, the last value.
